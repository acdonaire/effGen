# Contributing to effGen

Thank you for your interest in contributing to effGen! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (for integration tests)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ctrl-gaurav/effGen.git
cd effGen

# Create a virtual environment
conda create -n effgen python=3.11 -y
conda activate effgen

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (no GPU required)
pytest tests/unit/ -v --no-cov

# Integration tests (requires GPU)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 pytest tests/integration/ -v -m gpu --no-cov

# Performance benchmarks
pytest tests/benchmarks/ -v --no-cov

# All tests with coverage
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Cleaning up artifacts

Test, build, and runtime runs leave gitignored artifacts behind (caches, coverage,
`./checkpoints`, `__pycache__`, etc.). Tidy the tree at any time with:

```bash
scripts/clean.sh            # remove caches, coverage, build artifacts, runtime state
scripts/clean.sh --dry-run  # preview what would be removed
```

It only deletes already-ignored artifacts — never tracked source, `.git/`, or `.env`.

## Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting (line length: 100)
- **isort** for import sorting (profile: black)
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking
- **bandit** for security linting

All these run automatically via pre-commit hooks. You can also run them manually:

```bash
black effgen/
isort effgen/
flake8 effgen/
mypy effgen/ --ignore-missing-imports
```

### Type hints and the static-check ratchet

effGen ships `effgen/py.typed`, so every user's type checker checks their code
against our annotations. Two rules follow from that:

1. **Every public signature is fully annotated.** A non-underscore `def` in a
   public module — dunders included, since the language calls them — annotates
   each parameter and its return type. An unannotated one silently becomes
   `Any` in a user's type check. `tests/unit/test_public_signature_hints.py`
   enforces it at zero tolerance, which is what stops a new module arriving
   with an untyped public surface: mypy is configured with
   `disallow_untyped_defs = false`, so it reports nothing at all for one.

2. **The recorded mypy result may improve, never regress.** This is the second,
   separate gate: it holds the errors mypy *does* report, so annotations that
   disagree with the code cannot accumulate. The configuration is permissive and
   the package does not type-check clean, so instead of a gate that would have
   to be switched off, the *recorded* result is gated:

   ```bash
   python scripts/mypy_ratchet.py            # gate: exit 1 if it got worse
   python scripts/mypy_ratchet.py --update   # re-record after an improvement
   ```

   `scripts/mypy_baseline.json` holds every error's identity — its file, error
   code and message, with the line and column dropped so moving code around does
   not read as a new problem — together with how often each occurs. A new
   identity, a recorded one occurring more often, or a higher total fails the
   build. Because a different mypy reports a different set, `requirements-dev.txt`
   pins the version exactly and the ratchet refuses to compare across versions;
   bumping the pin means re-recording the baseline in the same change.

### The linter's target version tracks the supported Python floor

`[tool.ruff] target-version` in `pyproject.toml` equals the `requires-python`
floor, currently 3.10. Several pyupgrade rules are gated behind the target and
rewrite code that the floor cannot run — `UP017` (`datetime.UTC`), `UP041` (the
bare `TimeoutError` alias) and `UP042` (`enum.StrEnum`) need 3.11, and `UP047`
(PEP 695 type parameters) needs 3.12. They are therefore off because of the
target, not because they were added to the `ignore` list; both facts are gated by
`tests/unit/test_static_check_ratchet.py`. When the floor moves, raise the
target, then apply those rules as their own change.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Write tests** for your changes (unit tests at minimum, integration tests if GPU-dependent)
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with a summary of your changes
4. **Ensure all tests pass**: `pytest tests/unit/ -v --no-cov`
5. **Submit your PR** with a clear description of the changes

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] Code passes `black --check` and `isort --check`
- [ ] No new `TODO`/`FIXME` without a tracking issue
- [ ] Documentation updated if public API changed

## Issue Reporting

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Python version (`python --version`)
- effGen version (`python -c "import effgen; print(effgen.__version__)"`)
- GPU info (if relevant): `nvidia-smi`
- Full error traceback
- Steps to reproduce

## Architecture Overview

```

### Key Design Principles

- **Open Source First**: All features must work without paid APIs
- **SLM-Optimized**: Prompts and tools designed for 1B-7B parameter models
- **Tools extend `BaseTool`** with `async _execute()` method
- **Agent uses ReAct loop**: Thought → Action → Observation → repeat
