"""Unified diffs for the coding agent's file edits.

A write the agent proposes is shown as a unified diff before it touches disk, so
the change is reviewable. This module generates those diffs from
:mod:`difflib`, renders them with the CLI theme's colors, and applies a diff as
individual hunks against the file's current content — so a hunk that no longer
matches (the file changed since the edit was prepared) is reported precisely and
the hunks that still apply are kept, rather than the file being overwritten
whole.

Nothing here reads or writes the filesystem or calls a model: it operates on the
two strings (the current content and the proposed content) it is handed.
