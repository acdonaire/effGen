"""Proposed edits and the per-workspace undo journal for ``effgen code``.

Two pieces:

- :class:`ProposedEdit` — a single file write the agent wants to make, captured
  before it happens: the path, the file's current content, the proposed content,
  and the unified diff between them. The gated file tool builds one of these so a
  write can be previewed and applied hunk-by-hunk against the file's live content
  rather than overwriting it blindly.
- :class:`EditJournal` — a bounded, on-disk stack of the edits a workspace has
  applied, so ``effgen code --undo`` can restore the previous content of the last
  change (or delete a file the run created). The journal lives outside the
  workspace, under the effGen state directory, keyed to the workspace path, so it
  never appears in the files the agent sees.
