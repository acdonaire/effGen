"""The one git action ``effgen code`` can take: a confirmed commit of its edits.

The coding agent reads a repository through the read-only ``git`` tool. Writing
to one is a separate, deliberately narrow capability that lives here and nowhere
else:

- only ``git add`` and ``git commit``, both limited to the paths the run wrote;
- only after a human confirms, or after the caller passed the flag that means
  "do not ask" — the model can never reach it, because it is not a tool;
- the commit carries the repository's configured identity; an unconfigured
  identity is reported rather than worked around;
- pushing, force-pushing, tagging, amending, resetting, checking out, stashing
  and cleaning are rejected by :func:`ensure_safe`, which every command in this
  module passes through before it runs.

The commit is pathspec-limited (``git commit -- <paths>``), so work the user had
staged for other files stays staged and uncommitted: the agent commits what it
wrote, never what it found.

:func:`unsafe_shell_git` extends the same limits to the shell, so the model
cannot reach ``git push`` or ``git reset --hard`` by asking the ``bash`` tool
instead of using this module.
