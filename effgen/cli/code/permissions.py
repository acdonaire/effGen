"""Permission modes and the gate that applies them to a coding run.

A coding agent's two side effects are *writing files* and *executing commands*.
Both go through :class:`PermissionGate` before they reach the underlying tool, so
a run's disk and process effects are decided by an explicit policy rather than by
whatever the model happened to call.

Four action kinds are distinguished, because they carry different risk:

- ``write`` — a file write into the workspace (``file_operations``).
- ``run`` — code executed in the configured sandbox (``code_executor`` with a
  sandboxed language, ``python_repl``).
- ``shell`` — a shell command (``bash``, or ``code_executor`` with
  ``language="bash"``). The shell runs with the caller's own permissions, so it
  is gated more tightly than a sandboxed run.
- ``git`` — a commit of the files a run wrote (:mod:`effgen.cli.code.git_actions`).
  No tool can request one: it is only ever asked for by the person driving the
  session, and it still passes the gate so the decision is recorded like any
  other.

The four modes:

============  ==========  ==========  ==========  ==========
mode          write       run         shell       git
============  ==========  ==========  ==========  ==========
``plan``      deny        deny        deny        deny
``ask``       confirm     confirm     confirm     confirm
``auto-edit`` allow       allow       confirm     confirm
``yes``       allow       allow       allow       allow
============  ==========  ==========  ==========  ==========

``confirm`` asks the human and needs a terminal. Without one there is nobody to
ask, so the action is withheld and recorded — a non-interactive run never writes
or executes on an implied "yes". Every decision, including the refusals, lands in
:attr:`PermissionGate.actions` so the caller can report exactly what happened and
what did not.

Confinement is enforced here too: :meth:`PermissionGate.resolve_path` resolves a
path against the workspace root and refuses anything that escapes it or that
carries a credentials-file name, before the tool is reached.
