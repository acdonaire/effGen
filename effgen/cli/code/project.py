"""Repository detection and the project context ``effgen code`` starts from.

Before the first turn the coding agent needs to know what it is working on: is
this a git repository, which branch, what is already modified, and which files
exist. This module answers that with a few read-only git commands and a bounded
file inventory, and turns it into two things:

- a one-line summary for the banner
  (``Repo: effGen · branch main · 3 change(s) · 412 file(s)``),
- a compact block appended to the system prompt so the model can ask for the
  files it needs instead of guessing at paths.

Inside a repository the inventory comes from ``git ls-files`` with the standard
exclusions, so ``.gitignore`` is respected without reimplementing it. Outside one
the directory is walked with a small skip list and no error is raised — a plain
workspace is a supported way to work.

Everything here reads; nothing in this module changes a repository. The one
mutating action the coding agent offers lives in :mod:`effgen.cli.code.git_actions`
behind an explicit confirmation.
