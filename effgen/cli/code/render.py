"""Shared terminal rendering for the coding agent's diffs, ticks and summary.

Both the single-shot command (:mod:`effgen.cli.commands.code`) and the
interactive REPL (:mod:`effgen.cli.code.repl`) show the same things — a pending
edit as a colorized unified diff, a decided action as a one-line tick, and the
one-glance run footer — so those renderers live here and are called from both.

Every function routes through the CLI's human stream (``cli._human()`` /
``cli._human_stream()``), so a piped or ``--json`` invocation keeps this chatter
on stderr and leaves stdout for the answer or the JSON document.
