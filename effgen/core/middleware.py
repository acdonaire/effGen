"""Hooks around an agent run, its model calls and its tool calls.

effGen ships guardrails, observability, reliability and cost tracking as
subsystems. Middleware is the general form of the same idea: a place to put
behaviour effGen does not ship — an approval gate, a cache, a redaction pass, a
per-run spend cap, a custom trace exporter — without patching the loop.

There are three points, and each has a "before" and an "after":

- **the run** — once per :meth:`Agent.run`;
- **each model call** — every generation the run makes, including retries;
- **each tool call** — every dispatch the loop makes.

A ``before_`` hook may modify the request in place through its context, or
return a value to **short-circuit**: the real call is skipped and the returned
value is used instead. An ``after_`` hook receives the result and returns it,
possibly changed. ``before_`` hooks run in the order the middleware were given;
``after_`` hooks run in reverse, so a middleware wraps the ones after it the way
nested context managers do.

Subclass :class:`AgentMiddleware` and override only what you need::

    class BlockExpensiveTools(AgentMiddleware):
        def before_tool_call(self, ctx):
            if ctx.tool_name == "web_search" and ctx.budget_spent > 1.0:
                return "Skipped: this run has spent its search budget."

    agent = Agent(AgentConfig(model="gpt-5-nano", middleware=[BlockExpensiveTools()]))

Middleware can also be given per call, and are appended to the configured ones
for that run only::

    agent.run(task, middleware=[Timing()])

A hook that raises is not caught here — the exception reaches the caller like
any other error in the run, which is what makes an approval gate that refuses
able to stop the run.
