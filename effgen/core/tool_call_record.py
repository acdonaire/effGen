"""What a run's tool calls were, not just how many there were.

:attr:`~effgen.core.agent_response.AgentResponse.tool_calls` reports the calls a
run made: which tool, with what arguments, what came back, how long it took and
whether it failed. Error analysis and debugging both start from *which* call
went wrong, which a bare count cannot answer.

The field reads as a sequence and compares as a number, so both of these work
on the same object::

    for call in result.tool_calls:
        print(call.name, call.arguments, call.error)

    assert result.tool_calls == 2        # still compares like the old count
    if result.tool_calls > 0: ...

:attr:`ToolCallList.count` is the authoritative number of calls the run made.
It equals ``len()`` whenever the records were captured, and exceeds it only on
a path that reported a count without them — reading ``count`` rather than
``len()`` is therefore the safe way to ask "how many".
