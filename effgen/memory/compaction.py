"""How a conversation is shortened when it approaches the context window.

Small models have small windows, so what gets dropped and what survives changes
the answer more for them than for a frontier model. Different tasks want
different answers to that: a long support chat wants a summary, a tool-heavy
run wants the tool results kept and the reasoning dropped, a document workflow
wants the first turn and the last few verbatim.

A strategy answers three questions, and effGen calls them in this order:

1. :meth:`~CompactionStrategy.should_compact` — is it time?
2. :meth:`~CompactionStrategy.messages_to_compact` — which messages leave the
   live window?
3. :meth:`~CompactionStrategy.summarize` — what replaces them, if anything?

:class:`SummarizeOldest` is the default and is what effGen has always done:
summarize everything but the most recent few once the history passes a fraction
of the window. Pass another on the agent, or for one call::

    from effgen.memory.compaction import KeepFirstAndLast

    agent = Agent(AgentConfig(
        model="gpt-5-nano",
        memory_config={"compaction_strategy": KeepFirstAndLast(first=2, last=6)},
    ))

Token counts come from the model's own tokenizer when there is one, so the
threshold is measured in the units the window is measured in rather than in
characters divided by four.
