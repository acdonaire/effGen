"""Per-principal daily cost tracking for RBAC cost caps.

Each authenticated principal accrues spend against the ``max_cost_per_day``
of its effective policy. When the accrued spend for the current UTC day meets
or exceeds the cap, further charged requests are rejected with
:class:`BudgetExceeded` (surfaced as HTTP 429 by the API server).

The tracker is process-local and in-memory by default. A daily snapshot is
optionally persisted to ``~/.effgen/budget/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`` so that spend
survives a restart within the same day; set ``EFFGEN_BUDGET_PERSIST=0`` to
disable persistence.

This is intentionally simple — a single-process counter. For multi-replica
deployments back it with a shared store (Redis); the public API
(:func:`charge`, :func:`get_spend`, :func:`reset`) is the integration point.
