"""Shared filesystem path-confinement helper for built-in tools.

Document/media tools (ocr, pdf, docx, excel, image_info, qr_read,
audio_transcribe, data_analysis, image_caption, …) take a filesystem path. Left
unconfined, a tool argument is an arbitrary file *read* primitive — and tools
that then upload the bytes to a third-party API (OCR, captioning) turn that into
exfiltration under prompt injection.

Two layers, both built on ``FileOperations``' resolve-then-check model:

* **Default (no ``allowed_directories``):** a *deny-list* blocks the sensitive
  locations an attacker actually wants — ``/etc`` (``/etc/passwd``,
  ``/etc/shadow``), ``/proc``/``/sys``/``/dev``, ``/root``, kernel/boot, mounted
  secrets, and per-user credential stores (``~/.ssh``, ``~/.aws``, ``~/.gnupg``,
  ``~/.kube``, ``~/.config/gcloud``, ``~/.docker``, ``~/.netrc``, …). It also
  refuses a path whose *filename* matches a common credentials-file shape
  (``.env``, ``id_rsa``, ``credentials``, …), the same names ``bash_tool``
  already refuses to ``cat``. Ordinary files (a report under the project, a
  scan in a temp dir) still work, so the tools stay usable for their intended
  purpose.
* **Confined (``allowed_directories=[...]``):** the documented opt-in tightens to
  a strict allow-list — only those roots are readable (and the deny-list still
  applies). This is the ``FileOperations`` posture for callers that want it.

Resolution follows symlinks (``Path.resolve``), so a symlink pointing at a denied
location (or outside the allow-list) is rejected too.

The filename check does not catch a credentials file renamed to an innocuous
extension (``.env`` saved as ``.csv``). :func:`check_content_not_credentials`
covers that case: a caller reads the file's text and passes it through before
returning parsed data or extracted text to the model, so a dotenv-shaped
``KEY=VALUE`` block or a private-key header is refused regardless of the
extension that got it past the filename check.
