"""Shared presentation layer — one consistent look across CLI and notebooks.

This package is a *thin, dependency-light* home for how effGen renders things to
a human: the single Rich color theme, a themed :class:`~rich.console.Console`
factory, and the helpers that turn an answer (markdown, code, tables) into a
nice terminal view or a Jupyter HTML card.

It deliberately imports only :mod:`rich` and the standard library so that core
objects (e.g. ``AgentResponse``) can render themselves without pulling in the
heavy CLI module. ``NO_COLOR`` is honored everywhere.
