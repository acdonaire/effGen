"""Self-contained HTML reports for ``run`` / ``compare`` / ``eval`` / ``cost`` / ``loadtest``.

Renders a result object that a command already produced into a single ``.html``
file that can be emailed, attached, or opened from disk. The output has no
external references of any kind: every style, script, and chart is inline, so
the file renders identically with the network disabled.

Colors come from :mod:`effgen.ui.palette`, the same source the dashboard uses,
and are emitted as CSS custom properties for a light and a dark palette. The
page follows the reader's ``prefers-color-scheme`` and carries a toggle that
overrides it per view.

Six report shapes share one visual system, one per module:

``run`` (:mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_run`)
    One agent run as a shareable card: the task, the model it ran on, the
    answer (or the typed error), the step-by-step tool trace with per-step
    durations, sources and citations, and the run's tokens, cost and latency.
``comparison`` (:mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_comparison`)
    Per-model accuracy / latency / cost for a bake-off, with the recommended
    model and the reason it was picked.
``eval`` (:mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_eval`)
    Suite pass rate, the exit gate, a by-difficulty breakdown, and every case.
``cost`` (:mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_cost`)
    Spend for a period against the configured daily budget, by provider/model.
``loadtest`` (:mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_loadtest`)
    Latency percentiles, throughput, error rate, and the error breakdown.
``battle`` (:mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_battle`)
    Several models on one prompt: the tally, the verdict, and every answer.

All six draw on the same three shared layers: :mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_format`
(escaping, value formatting, document normalizing),
:mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_components` (cards, tables, badges, inline charts),
and :mod:`effgen.ui.report_html_page` (the inline stylesheet, script and page
shell). Every name they define is re-exported here, so this module stays the
one import path for the report renderer.

Typical use::

    from effgen.ui.report_html import write_html_report

    write_html_report("bakeoff.html", matrix.to_dict(), kind="comparison")

:func:`detect_report_kind` identifies a saved ``--json`` document, so a result
captured earlier can be rendered later without re-running any model.
