"""Read and check the register of tests known to fail for a reason outside the tree.

A suite that is re-run until it goes green teaches nobody anything. The register
(``tests/flake_register.toml``) is the alternative: a test that can fail for a reason
the tree does not control is written down once, with the reason, the class of cause,
the part of the tree that has to deal with it, when it was first seen and the date the
entry stops being an answer.

Two things read this file. The scripts that drive the whole suite over several orders
use :func:`entry_for` to separate a known cause from a new one, so a run reports "one
known flake, zero new failures" rather than "one failure". A gate test uses
:func:`violations` so an entry cannot be added without a reason and an owner, cannot
outlive the test it names, and cannot sit past its expiry date.
