"""Run the suite without the ambient state of the machine it runs on.

A test that reads the developer's home directory, an environment variable nobody in
the suite set, or a host on the network passes on the machine that has those things
and fails on the machine that does not. The failure lands on whoever runs the suite
next, usually in CI, and the cause is invisible from the test body.

Setting ``EFFGEN_TEST_HERMETIC=1`` removes all three before collection starts:

* ``HOME`` (with ``USERPROFILE`` and the ``XDG_*`` directories) points at an empty
  temporary directory, so a read of ``~/.effgen`` finds nothing rather than the
  developer's own configuration, history and cost database;
* the process environment is reduced to a declared allowlist — no provider
  credentials, no CI, editor, terminal, session or toolchain-adjacent variables — and
  the repository ``.env`` is not loaded, by the suite or by anything it starts;
* a connection to anything other than loopback is refused with a typed error, so a
  test that reaches the internet says so instead of depending on the runner's route.

Everything the suite itself sets afterwards (the isolated cost database, the run
history directory) survives, because the scrub runs first.

Two declared exceptions to the scrub:

* the artifact caches (``HF_HOME`` and friends) are re-pointed at their real
  locations. They are a content-addressed download store, not a decision input, and
  dropping them turns "this model is already on disk" into a network fetch, which
  the same guard then refuses. Set ``EFFGEN_TEST_HERMETIC_CACHES=0`` to drop them too
  and measure the suite against an empty cache.
* the interpreter's own search paths (``PATH``, ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, the conda and
  virtualenv prefixes) are kept, because a subprocess test needs to find the
  interpreter it was started with.
