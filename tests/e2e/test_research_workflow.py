# A 3B instruct model reliably calls the right tool and gets the right value,
# but does not always close the loop with a well-formed final answer inside a
# fixed iteration budget. These tests therefore assert what the framework
# controls — the tool ran, the answer is in the run, and the run ended for a
# known reason — rather than asserting that a small model always emits the
# final-answer form, which would make them flaky rather than strict.
#
# "Known reason" means every way the framework completes a run holding the
# answer, not only the two a larger model usually takes. When the model repeats
# a call to a tool whose output is a computed result, the loop stops and returns
# that result: a success, reported as one, with the value in the output. Reading
# the recovered set from the framework rather than restating it here is what
# stops this list going stale the next time a completion path is added.
