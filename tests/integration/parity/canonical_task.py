"""Canonical parity tasks for effGen backend interchangeability tests.

Two complementary tasks let the parity suite check different guarantees without
conflating them:

* **Answer correctness** — ``run_canonical_task`` asks ``(17 * 23) + sqrt(144)``
  (expected ``403``). Every backend must reach the right answer, *by whatever
  path it chooses*. A small model leans on the Calculator; a capable reasoning
  model may do the trivial arithmetic in its head. Both are correct, so this
  task does not require a tool call.

* **Tool calling actually works** — ``run_tool_required_task`` asks for a value
  that is impossible to know without calling the tool (an opaque inventory count
  behind a fictitious SKU). The only way to answer is to invoke the tool, so a
  passing run is honest proof that the backend's tool-calling path is wired up —
  even for a model clever enough to shortcut arithmetic.
