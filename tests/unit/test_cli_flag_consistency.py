"""A flag spells the same concept the same way in every command that has it.

Read from the live argument parser, not from the source, so an option added
anywhere in the parser tree is covered without being registered here.

Three properties hold across the whole command surface:

* Every option documents itself, so ``--help`` never lists a bare flag.
* A short flag names one concept. Where two long names describe the same
  concept — ``--model``/``--models`` for one model or several — they may share
  a short form; that pairing is declared below.
* A concept that has a short form somewhere has the same short form
  everywhere it appears.

The declared exceptions each carry their reason. Repointing a short flag that
users already type is a breaking change, so the two pre-existing collisions are
recorded below rather than silently accepted.
