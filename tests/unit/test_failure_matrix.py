"""Every provider adapter against every way a provider call goes wrong.

One table: nine adapters by nine failure classes. Each cell drives the real
adapter through its real SDK over a real socket against a loopback peer that
produces the failure at the transport layer, and asserts the same five things —
a typed, classified error; the right retry verdict; no hang; no credential
handed back to the caller; and never a quiet success.

Covering a new provider is a row in
:data:`tests.unit.failure_injection.PROVIDERS`; covering a new failure class is
a row in :data:`~tests.unit.failure_injection.FAILURES` plus one handler on the
fault server. Neither needs a new module, and
:func:`test_the_matrix_covers_every_adapter_and_class` fails if either is
skipped.
