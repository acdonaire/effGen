"""Guard the packaging single-source-of-truth invariants.

pyproject.toml is the one authoritative place for effGen's dependencies, extras,
and version. These tests fail loudly if a future change reintroduces the drift
the 0.3.0 packaging pass removed:

  * setup.py growing its own (divergent) dependency/extras declarations again,
  * requirements.txt falling out of sync with the base dependency table,
  * flash-attn sneaking back into [all] (its build breaks `pip install`),
  * fast-moving majors losing their tested upper bounds.
