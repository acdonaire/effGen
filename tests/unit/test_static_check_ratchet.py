"""The recorded static-check result may improve, never regress.

effGen's mypy configuration is permissive, so the package does not type-check
clean and a "must be clean" gate would have to be switched off. A lane that is
off cannot notice anything, so the recorded result is gated instead:
``scripts/mypy_baseline.json`` holds every error's identity with how often it
occurs, and ``scripts/mypy_ratchet.py`` fails when a new identity appears, when
a recorded one occurs more often, or when the total rises. That keeps
annotations which disagree with the code from accumulating; unannotated public
signatures are a different gate, ``test_public_signature_hints.py``, because
``disallow_untyped_defs = false`` means mypy reports nothing for one.

The checks here run without mypy installed: they validate the baseline document
and drive the comparison over synthetic transcripts, including one carrying a
planted error, so the gate itself is proven to catch a regression. Running mypy
for real is the ``static-check ratchet`` CI job.

The linter's target version is checked here too, because it is the same
decision: ``[tool.ruff] target-version`` tracks the ``requires-python`` floor,
and several pyupgrade rules are version-gated behind it.
