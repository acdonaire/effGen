"""E3-2 — local batch must not trip the fast tokenizer's "Already borrowed".

HuggingFace "fast" (Rust) tokenizers are not thread-safe: two threads encoding
on the same tokenizer at once raise ``RuntimeError("Already borrowed")``. The
batch runner drives an agent at concurrency>1, so the engine must serialize
tokenizer access. These tests use an in-process fake tokenizer that *detects*
overlapping access and raises the same error — no real model is loaded, and no
live behaviour is mocked; they verify the engine's own locking.
